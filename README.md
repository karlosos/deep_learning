## Assignments

1. Multi Layer Perceptron on `tf.keras`. Compare activation functions, optimizers, learning rates and number of epochs for MNIST.
2. Convolution-Neural-Network on `tf.keras`. Compare simple architectures on MNIST dataset.
3. Combined model - MLP and CNN. Real estate price prediction based on photos and numerical data.
4. Olivetti Faces on CNN.
5. DCGAN - generating faces of single person. 


## Development

1. Create virtual environment with `virtualenv .venv`.
2. Activate venv with `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.

## Why the hell didn't you refactor this? :angry:

I got my grade and this code won't be used again.

> "Let me stress that it’s these changes that drive the need to perform refactoring. If the code works and doesn’t ever need to change, it’s perfectly fine to leave it alone. It would be nice to improve it, but unless someone needs to understand it, it isn’t causing any real harm. Yet as soon as someone does need to understand how that code works, and struggles to follow it, then you have to do something about it." Martin Fowler - Refactoring
